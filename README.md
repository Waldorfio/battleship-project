# Project: Battleship Game
An implementation of the classic battleship game.
Application built using vanilla JavaScript ES6, CSS3, and HTML5. Packaged using Webpack.

### Features
- Create a custom gameboard with various battleships	
- Verse an randomised AI
    - Interact with a hidden enemy gameboard to fire shots
- Observe shots received on your own gameboard

### Goals
- Practice the basics of testing using Jest
- Practice working with Test Driven Development (TDD) concepts in mind
- Actively avoid running into the tightly-coupled problem, through the use of TDD

### Challenges Faced
- Learning Jest
- Actively applying TDD, over console.logs and DOM error traceback
- Actively developing pure functions
